# Farm_calc
This is a simulation of a calculator that can compute the number of years required for a lama farm to reach a certain population from a specified one from the user
,knowing that each year, 1/3 of the number lamas die, and 1/2 of the number of lamas are born

(Note: The start and End population should be at least 10 lamas to start the program correctly).
